# Wunderweather-Scraper

A scraper that, through Selenium, scrapes weather data of user-entered city of the whole year of 2021 from [WunderGround](https://www.wunderground.com/)

Gives an interactive graph of Average Temperature, Average Wind Speed, Average Humidity and Precipitation throughout all the year with day-wise precision.

Exception: Doesn't support U.S States yet, which is subject to change in the future.

#### Run this interactively on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1S1W_CkdmWN8xvbvpGjm8oDZySnvthM16?usp=sharing).
